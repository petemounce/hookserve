# HookServe

http://godoc.org/github.com/phayes/hookserve/hookserve

HookServe is a small golang utility for receiving github webhooks. It's easy to use, flexible, and provides strong security though GitHub's HMAC webhook verification scheme.

```go
server := hookserve.NewServer()
server.Port = 8888
server.Secret = "supersecretcode"
server.GoListenAndServe()

// Everytime the server receives a webhook event, print the results
for event := range server.Events {
    fmt.Println(event.Owner + " " + event.Repo + " " + event.Branch + " " + event.Commit)
}
```

## Command Line Utility

It also comes with a command-line utility that lets you pass webhook push events to other commands. 

```sh
$ hookserve --port=8888 logger -t PushEvent #log github webhook push event to the system log (/var/log/message) via the logger command
```
